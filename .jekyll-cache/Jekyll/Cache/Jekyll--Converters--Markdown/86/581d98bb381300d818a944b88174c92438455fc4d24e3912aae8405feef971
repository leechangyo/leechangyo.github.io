<ul>
  <li>there equations will show up again and again</li>
  <li>what is stationary?</li>
  <li>A stationary process is one whose statistics donâ€™t change over rime(e.g mean)</li>
  <li>weak-sense stationary: mean(1st order statistic) and autocovariance(2nd order statistic) donâ€™t change overtime
    <ul>
      <li>if donâ€™t know covariance letâ€™s check it in <a href="https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EA%B3%B5%EB%B6%84%EC%82%B0">here</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>strong-sense stationary: entire PDF doesnâ€™t change over time</li>
  <li>SSS -&gt; WSS</li>
  <li>what if our bandits are not stationary? does it make sense to calculate the mean as we have been?</li>
</ul>
