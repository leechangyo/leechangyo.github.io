<ul>
  <li>this section is a 3rd technique for solving MDPs</li>
  <li>TD = Temporal Difference(TD) Learning</li>
  <li>Combines ideas from DP and MC</li>
  <li>Disadvantage of DP: requires full model of environment, never learns from experience</li>
  <li>MC and TD learn from experience</li>
  <li>MC can only update after completing episode, but DP uses Bootstrapping(Making an initial estimate)</li>
  <li>We will see that TD also uses Bootstrapping and is fully online, can update value during an episode
    <h2 id="1-td-learning">1. TD Learning</h2>
  </li>
  <li>Same approach as before</li>
  <li>First Predict Problem</li>
  <li>them control problem</li>
</ul>
