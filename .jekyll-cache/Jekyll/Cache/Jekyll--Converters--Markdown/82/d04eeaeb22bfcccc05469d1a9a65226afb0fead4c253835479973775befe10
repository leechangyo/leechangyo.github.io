  <li>what might happen if we plugged in a neural network instead of a linear model?</li>
  <li>we have seen how we can plug in a tensorflow model into q_learning.py script(Tensorflow_warmup)</li>
  <li>put them together</li>
  <li>try removing RBF layer since presumably(很可能) a deep neural network will automatically learn features</li>

<ul>
  <li>lots of attention recently, in relation to “transfer learning”</li>
  <li>train AI on one game, keep some weights, train on another game
