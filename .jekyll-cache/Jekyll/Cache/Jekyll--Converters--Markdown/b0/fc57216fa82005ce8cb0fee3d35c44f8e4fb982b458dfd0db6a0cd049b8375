<ul>
  <li>State space can grow too large to feasibly enumerate</li>
  <li>Approximation methods allow us to compress number of parameters</li>
  <li>Differentiable Model are good fit, because we can use stochastic gradient descent</li>
  <li><strong>Online learning is good</strong> because if we have a long episode, agent can learn during the episode</li>
  <li>Everything we learned is just as applicable to deep learning / neural nets</li>
  <li>x = (i,j) is not expressive enough, so we used feature engineering</li>
  <li>we applied approximation to:
    <ul>
      <li>MC prediction</li>
      <li>TD(0) prediction (semi-gradient)</li>
      <li>SARSA(semi-gradient)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
