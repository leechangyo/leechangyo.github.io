<ul>
  <li>there equations will show up again and again</li>
  <li>what is stationary?</li>
  <li>A stationary process is one whose statistics don’t change over rime(e.g mean)</li>
  <li>weak-sense stationary: mean(1st order statistic) and autocovariance(2nd order statistic) don’t change overtime</li>
  <li>strong-sense stationary: entire PDF doesn’t change over time</li>
  <li>SSS -&gt; WSS</li>
  <li>what if our bandits are not stationary? does it make sense to calculate the mean as we have been?</li>
</ul>
