<ul>
  <li>Small set of rules to ensure we never lose</li>
  <li>we enumerate(Âàó‰∏æ) the rule of Tic-Tac-Toe. but we won‚Äôt. still consider what they might be( Ex, if board is empty and it‚Äôs our turn, place our piece in the center or corner)(Ex2, if opponent has 2 piece in a row, block the 3rd postion so they don‚Äôt win)(Ex3, if we have 2 piece in a row, add a 3rd so we can win the game)</li>
  <li>Code would like this
    <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">if</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">...</span><span class="p">):</span>
<span class="p">{</span><span class="o">...</span><span class="p">}</span>
<span class="k">else</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">...</span><span class="p">):</span>
<span class="p">{</span><span class="o">...</span><span class="p">}</span>
<span class="k">else</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">...</span><span class="p">):</span>
<span class="p">{</span><span class="o">...</span><span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>Goes against the whole idea of ML</li>
  <li>We want one algorithm that can generalize(Ê¶ÇÊã¨) to many problem(E.g neural network can classify pictures of animals, can also classify music)</li>
  <li>An agent made up of it statements will never be able to do anything other than just play tic-tac-toe(Agent only doing tic-tac-toe)</li>
  <li>Important: we have a model for how the game works. we know everything about tic-tac-toe</li>
  <li>We Know what state yields the highest reward(any state where we have 3 pieces in a row)</li>
  <li>i.e. by doing some action, we know the next state is given the current state(predict)</li>
  <li>Seems Trivial(‰∏çÈáçË¶ÅÁöÑ), but not always the case</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>the idea of having a model of the environment will come into play later.</li>
  <li>some algorithms we‚Äôll learn will require us to have a model, like tic-tac-toe</li>
  <li>other algorithms won‚Äôt require us to know anything, we‚Äôll just explore the world and consume information as we go along</li>
