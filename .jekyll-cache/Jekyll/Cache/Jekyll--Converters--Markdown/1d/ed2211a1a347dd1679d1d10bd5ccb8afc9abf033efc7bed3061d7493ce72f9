  <li>what might happen if we plugged in a neural network instead of a linear model?</li>
  <li>we have seen how we can plug in a tensorflow model into q_learning.py script(Tensorflow_warmup)</li>
  <li>put them together</li>
  <li>try removing RBF layer since presumably(å¾ˆå¯èƒ½) a deep neural network will automatically learn features</li>

<ul>
  <li>lots of attention recently, in relation to â€œtransfer learningâ€</li>
  <li>train AI on one game, keep some weights, train on another game</li>
  <li>showed the neural net can be trained such that the AI still performs well on the first game</li>
  <li>so it didnâ€™t just learn the 2nd game and forget the 1st game</li>
  <li>this is noteworthy(å€¼å¾—æ³¨æ„çš„) because itâ€™s not how neural networks work by default</li>
  <li>more typically we would expect the neural net to forget how to play the 1st game</li>
  <li>Doesnâ€™t only apply across different tasks</li>
  <li>Stochastic/ batch gradient descent -&gt; cost can â€œjumpâ€ around</li>
  <li>seems more pronounced on highly nonlinear regression problems</li>
  <li><strong>weâ€™d like the data in cost function to represent true distribution of data</strong></li>
  <li>even using all training data simultaneously is only an approximation of the â€œtrueâ€ data</li>
  <li>E.g. clinical trial for a drug, we sample 1000 subjects. we hope they are representative of the population as a whole</li>
  <li>So when we use batch/Stochastic GD, the approximation becomes even worse</li>
  <li>in RL, itâ€™s even worse because thereâ€™s a large bias in the ordering of training samples</li>
</ul>
