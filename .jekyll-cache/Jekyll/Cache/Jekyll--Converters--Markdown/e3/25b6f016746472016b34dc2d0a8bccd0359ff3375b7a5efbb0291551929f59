Business school will \nprepare you to create or lead an organization, manage resources, develop effective operational \nstrategies, and more. \nOnce \nadmitted, r\nequired coursework typically include\ns: Organizational \nBehavior, Marketing, Accounting, Finance, Strategy\n, \nand Operations Management. This is followed \nby elective coursework that allows the student to customize their experience. Some students \n\ncon\nsider an MBA as essential for advancement to a management role while others will use it as a \n\nmeans to change careers. As an undergraduate student, it is unlikely that you will be admitted to \n\nenter directly into an MBA program without first working for a fe\nw years. This period of \n\nemployment will give you time to think about your long term goals and help you determine if a \n\ngraduate degree is appropriate.\n Informational \nmeetings\n Talking with\n people (with or without MBAs) currently working in\n field\ns that inter\nest you\n can be \nextremely helpful as you consider your \nfuture career \noptions.\n Be sure to ask:\n How is an \nMBA viewed by the industry\n?Will an MBA improve your chances of being hired and moving ahead\n?If that person has an MBA, ask about their experience in the program they attended\nWhat was most helpful for you as you prepared your application?\nYour conversation can help you put into context how applicable the program will be to your career \n\ngoals. Also, speak with current students or those who have recently \ncompleted an MBA program. \nInquire about their experience in the program and how it has i\nmpact\ned their careers.\n What should you do to prepare for business school?\n There™s no magic formula for\n the perfect undergraduate conce\nntration\n, set of academic \nachievements, pre\n-MBA work experience\n, \nextracurricular accomplishments, essays\n, interviews, or \nrecommendation\ns. Nor is there a common \n\ncareer goal or industry in which you can \n\naspire to work. What MBAs have in common is \n\nthey find opportunities to take initiative, they \n\nare motivated, have a strong awareness of \n\nthemselves, and have a desire to learn and \n\ngrow.\n  \nBusiness schools tend to focus on impact \nmore than scale. Make sure, therefore, that the \n\nacademic and extracurricular choices you \n\nmake truly reflect your interests, demonstrate initiative, and give you opportunities to play a \n\nleadership role in the organization. A strong undergraduate academic record and GMAT (or \n\npossibly GRE) score are\n also\n important parts of your a\npplication to business school. Many sc\nhools \nallow you to sit in on a class to gain insight into what a typical course looks like. Take advantage of \n\nthis opportunity!\n Business schools look for leaders. In \nwhat ways have you demonstrated \ninitiative or translated a vision into a \n\nreality? Bear in mind that it™s not about \n\nthe size of your accomplishment, but the \npassion with which you invest in and \npursue your goals. \n'
