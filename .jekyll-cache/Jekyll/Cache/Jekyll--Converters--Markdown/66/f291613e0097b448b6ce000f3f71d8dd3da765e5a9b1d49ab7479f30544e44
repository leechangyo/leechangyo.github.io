  <li>Multi-Agent(many robot) play to find the target position and move</li>
  <li>MAPF problem: Find a collision-free plan(path) for each agent</li>
  <li>Another name we called it : Cooperative path finding(CPF), Multi-robot path planning, pebble(ÈπÖÂçµÁü≥) motion</li>

<ul>
  <li>a graph (directed or undirected)</li>
  <li>a set of agents(robot), each agent is assigned to two locations(nodes) in the graph(start, destination)</li>
  <li>Each agent can perform either move(to a neighbouring node) or wait(in the same node) actions</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Typical Assumption:
 all move and wait actions have identical durations(plans for agents are synchronized)</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Plan</strong> is a sequence of actions for the agent leading from its start location to its destination
    <ul>
      <li>the <strong>length of plan</strong>(for an agent) is defined by the time when the agent reaches its destination and does not leave it anymore.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Find <strong>Plans</strong> for all agents such that the plans <strong>do not collide in time and space</strong> (no two agents are at the same location at the same time)

  <li>some necessary <strong>conditions for plan existence</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>no two agents are at the same start node</li>
      <li>no two agents share the same destination node(unless an agent disappears when reaching its destination)</li>
      <li>the number of agents is strictly smaller than the number of nodes</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>agent at $v_i$ cannot perform move $v_j$ at the same time when agent at $v_j$ perform move $v_i$</li>
  <li>Agents may swap position. but agents use the same edges at the same time, swap is not allowed
