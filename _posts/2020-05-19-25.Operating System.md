- the software components consist of system software and application software. the application programs cannot directly interact with the hardware components and therefore needs a special system program called "Operating system" which can interact with the hardware components through a set of drivers. the operating system manages all application programs and system resourse.

- An operating system(OS) is system software that is designed to provide a user friendly interface between the computer system hardware and applications programs.

- Application praograms are user initiated program to perform different jobs on the computer system. A computer user interacts with the computer system through applications programs to get the various jobs done.

- An operating system is an interface between a computer user and computer hardware components connected to the system.

- the BIOS program initiates the booting sequence to search and load the operating system into the RAM. An operating system is a system software designed to control and manage computer system.

- the BIOS(Baisc input output system) is the set of program instruction used to boot a computer system. these routines(system software) provide basic drivers for peripherals such as the keyboard, monitor and mous. these drivers also provide the user with a way to edit or alter the configureations settings.

- An operating system provides two basic services
  - Abstraction(抽象概念)
    - Abstraction hides the complexities and details of different hardward configuration. application need not be device specific for each device connected to the computer system.
  - Arbitration(仲裁)
    - Arbitration ensures that all the system resources and hardware devices are shared amongst different processes running simultaneously on the system without any conflict

- the application program cannot directly interact with the system hardware components and input/output peripheral devcies connected to the system. AN operating system(OS) performs as an interface between a user applications and computer hardware.

- the application program can communicates with the system hardware components only through operating system. the operating system in turn communicates with the hardware components through a system software called "device drivers."

- An Operating system is an eseential component of the computer system. it is a system program which provides services, resources and runtime environment for application programs running on the computer system.

- An operating system architecture is a term that specifies the overall structure of the operating system, its logical components and the logical interrelationships of various components that constitute(构成) an operating system

- An operating system structure(OS design approach/architecture) can be classified based on the design approach and implementation by the operating system.

   - simple structure OS
   - layered approach OS
   - Monolithic Appoarch OS
   - Microkernel Approach OS
