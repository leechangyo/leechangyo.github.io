Homography is
Note that the homography matrix is a mapping between two planes. We have considered it here as a mapping from the image plane to a physical plane, but it could map between two image planes. The inverse of a homography will also provide the reverse mapping between the two planes.

disparity in image processing
The disparity image is one where the value of each pixel is inversely related to the distance between that point in the scene and the camera.
