- paradigm : approach to solve the program
- algorithm : step by step methodology to solve the problem
- Semantics : Meaning of the program
- Syntax : programming language rules to construct the program statements.

- the software applications are designed to solve a particular problem
- For example : A railway reservation system is designed to solve the railway ticket reservation problem for the customers and for the railway administration. the problem solved are :
  - ticket reservation by customers.
  - ticket rescheduling & Cancellation
  - Railway Resources Managements

- A program is a set of instructions that directs a computer in terms of sequential programming instructions to execute specific operations and provide a desired output as a solution to a particular problem.

- A computer software can be designed using any programming language. the choice of programming language depending upon the solution requirements.

- A programming paradigm is a framework that defines how the programmer can conceptualize and interpret complex problem to be solved.

- A programming paradigm is a particular style or "way" of writing and organizing a program code

- there are a number of alternative approaches to the programming process and these approaches are referred to as programming paradigms

- Different paradigms represent fundamentally different approaches to building solution to specific types of problems using programming as a tool.

- most programming languages fall under one paradigm, but some programming language have elements of multiple paradigms

- in general, the programming paradigms influence language design especially the manner in which program code is organized.

- the features of various programming languages determine which programming paradigms they belong to and as a result, some language fall into only one paradigm, while other fall into multiple paradigms.

- Multi-paradigm programming supports core concepts of more than one paradigm and therefore offers more functional convenience to the programmer while coding a program.
