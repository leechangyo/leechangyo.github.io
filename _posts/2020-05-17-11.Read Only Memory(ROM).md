- in computer architecture, a computer system makes the use of different types of memories and these memories can be classified as volatile and non-voltaile memory depending upon the ability of the memory to retain the data when system power supply is swithced off.

- the ROM stands for Read Only Memory which is a non-volatile memory that menas the contents of the ROM will not be lost even if the computer system supply is switched off.

- the ROM chip is type of IC(integrated Circuit) chip in which the data and program is embedded by the chip manufacturing company. Example: A BIOS chip which BIOS routines used in botting process.

- the data stored in the ROM cannot easily modified or with some difficulty. therefore the ROM chips are mainly used to distribute the data and programes very closely tied to the specific hardware.

- the ROM has data written permanently on it and is not reusable. However, there are certain kainds of ROM that can be rewitten and they are called EPROM(erasble Programmable Read Only Memory). these are generally in the form of CD-ROM or Floppy Dist that can be used to load the OS to the RAM.

- A firmware refers to Read-only Memory(ROM) chips that store permanent instructions. Mainly used to boot up computerized or digital devices. As ROM chips are non-volatile, meaning that they do not require a power source to hold thier contents.

- This differentiates it from Random Access Memory(RAM) which loses stored data at shutdown, for example: perhaps the most familiar example is the BIOS chip(basic input-output system.)
