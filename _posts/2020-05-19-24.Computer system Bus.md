# Computer system Bus

- the computer systems consist of number of components. there components are connected to each other with a network of wires running accross the computer. in computer architecture the connecting wire is referred as bus and the network is referred as "Bus system"

- Bus system
  - the performance of computer system depends upon number of factors such as CPU, RAM and the bus system is also one the important factor. the bus system is a network of individual Buses within a computer system.

## Internal and External Buses

- A computer system consist of number of internal components which mainly include CPU, MotherBoard, Internal add on cards(Graphic card, sound card, network card), RAM and hard disk

- A system bus is a set of parallel wires which connects the two or more independent major internal components of a computer system. system bus transfer data, memory addresses and device control instruction.

- the CPU contains a control unit which controls the functioning of all other components. the control bus is used to transfer the control signals form one component to another component

- A control bus is a computer bus that is used by the CPU to communicate with devices that are connected to the computer system. these devices are connected with the help of cables and printed circuits board.

- the CPU transmits a variety of control signal to the system components and the devices also transmit control signal to the CPU using the control bus

- the control bus is bidirectional and assists the CPU in synchronizing control signals to the internal devices and external components. the control bus includes device interrup signal lines, byte enable lines, memory read/write signals and status lines.

- the CPU executes the program instructions by fetching the instructions from the main memory RAM

- in order to perform the memory read or write operation from the main memory RAM, the CPU sends either read or write control signal on the control bus and address of the memory location along the "address bus" from where the operation is to be performed. the address bus is a part of the "system bus"

- Number of devices are connected to the computer system and each of this device has unique memory address(address in RAM)

- the CPU identifies these devices with reference to the device address and communicates with the device for different operations to be performed. A device can requiest action through a hardware interrupt. A seperate line coming from the device will go to an interrupt controller which produces a signal to notify the CPU that a dvice needs attention.

- in computer architecture, the data bus is a wired connection dedicated for transmiting the data between the CPU and other components. the data bus is a part of the system bus in addition to address bus and control bus.

- A data bus has many different features, but one of the most important feature is its width. the width of a data bus refers to the number of bits(electrical wires) that the bus is consist of. the common data bus widths includ 8 bit, 16 bit, 32 bit and 64 bit. wider the bus width, faster would be the data flow on the bus.

## What is a Expansion Bus?

- the performance features and functionality of a computer system can be extended by adding an additional cards such as graphics card or sound card

- the expansion slots are the ports located on the motherboard of a computer system in which an expansion cards can be installed. the user can used these slots to insert additional expansion cards as per the functional requirements.

- An expansion bus is a group of wire OR PCB used to connect with the expansion slots on the motherboard used for installing expansion cards.

- An expansion bus provides an input / output pathway for transferring information between internal hardware components such as RAM or the CPU and expansion cards such as a graphics card or sound cards.

## What is a Front side & Backside Bust

- FSB- Front Side bus:
  - the FSB is bus which physically connects the processor with the NorthBridge chipset and the main memory RAM, hard drives and PCI on the motherboard.

  - the FSB is also referred as system bus, memory bus, processor bus which is a part of the motherboard and conncets the processor to the main memory(RAM)

- Backside bus is a computer bus that connects CPU to Level2 cache memory. backside bus is a bus that is present inside the processor chip, which specifically link ALU and internal L2 cache, so that the flow of data from L2 cache can take place at a very high speed.

- the data flow through the backside bus is fater than the front side bus. backside bus(BSB) is a part of central processing unit now but the speed of this bus totally depends upon the speed of the processor.

## Bus types and FUnctions.
