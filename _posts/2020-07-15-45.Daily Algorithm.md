```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
        int result = 0;
        int n = x^y; // binary number로 만들어 준다.
        while(n)
        {
            n &= (n-1);
            result ++;
        }
        return result;


    }
};

Hi, I spent 4 hours thinking how it works. It's Brian Kernighan's algorithm.

1. After we got XOR (n = x ^ y) which gives us a binary where count of 1's (set bits) is exactly the number of different bits in the given pair of numbers,
we only need to count those 1's (set bits).
[0]1[1]00 ^
[1]1[0]00 =
[1]0[1]00

2. LOOP STARTS:
with (n-1) we will have all the bits flipped after the rightmost set bit(1) of n (including the rightmost set bit) and leave bits to the left untouched. Consider:
10[100] -
00[001] =
10[011]
or
111010[1]-
000000[1]=
111010[0]

3. now that we have 'inverted' the rightmost set bit, we can easily convert it and all the bits after it to 0 by doing n &= n -1;
10[100]&
10[011]=
10[000]

count this loop (++dist)

while loop breaks when we do operation 2 and 3 for the leftmost set bit (leftmost 1) because then n turns into 0.
LOOP ENDS.

return dist.

that's it :)
