- we make use of different kinds of number system to quantify(定量) different objects
- A numbering system is system followed to define a set of values used to measure a quantity.
- with the helping of numbering system we can express the quantitative dimension of any object.
- the computers are extensively used for performing complex calculations and can handle different types of data such as audio, video, images and many more.
- however, for computer this data in any form must be represented only in the form of numbers which a computer can understand and perform different actions as per program instruction
- the computer's CPU(brain) has been designed to interpret language expressed only by using two states (on or Off). these two states can be best represented by binary number system which makes use of only two numbers(0 and 1 ). therefore, a computer can interpret only binary representation which is a language of 0 and 1.

## types of number systems

- there are four basic numbering systems that are used in the human, networking, and computer science worlds.
- the Decimal(데시멀) numbering system we are most familiar which has a base, or radix, of 10 and to us this is natural. why 10? most of us have 10 fingers and that is how it was selected as our numbering systems.

- in mathematics and digital electronics, a binary number is a number expressed using binary numeral notation system or base - 2 numeral system which represents any numeric(0~9) values by using combination of only two possible values that is 0(zero) and 1(one). in digital electronics this is best suited to represent two states ON or OFF.

- hte base-2 number system is a positional notation with a radix(근원) of 2. because of its straightforward implementation in digital electronic circuitry using logic gates. the binary system is used intemally(内部地) by almost all modern computers and computer-based devices.

- therefore, computer is a digital electronic device and the CPU consist of millions of transistor which is fundamental building block for all CPU.

- the decimal numbering system is the most commonly used numbering systems that makes use of 10 digits starting from 0 to 9. any number can be represented by using combinations of any of these 10 numbers.

- a decimal number, or just decimal, refer to any number written in decimal notation, although it is more commonly used to refer to number that have a fractional(很小的) part sepreated from the integer part with a decimal separator.

- in mathematics and computing hexadecimal(also based 16, or hex) is a positional numeral system with a radix, or base of 16. it uses sixteen distinct symbols, most often the symbols 0-9 to represent values zero to nine, and A,B,C,D,E,F(or alternatively a,b,c,d,e,f) to represent values ten to fifteen.

- Hexadecimal numerals are widely used by computer system designers and programmers. as each hexadecimal digit represents four binary digits(bits). it allows a more human-friendly representation of binary-coded values as binary numbers are difficult to read.
