- **A gradient represents the slope of the tangent of the graph of the function. It gives the linear approximation of f at a point. It points toward the greatest rate of increase.**

## 2. Hessian

- Let f be twice differentiable.

- A Hessian gives a quadratic approximation of f at a point.
- Gradient and Hessian are local properties that help us recognize local solutions and determine a direction to move at toward the next point.
