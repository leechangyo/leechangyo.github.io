The approach involves the following:

- Keeping a running sum of all the elements so far as we iterate through them
- If the running sum is equal to k, then we can increment the answer by 1 because then we have found a valid subarray that starts from index 0
- If there is a prefix sum for sum-k in the map, that means we can form sum = k
- This is because the prefix sum for sum subtracted by the the prefix sum for sum-k is k (sum - (sum-k) = k). This means that we can take all of the elements up to sum and subtract it by all of the elements up to sum-k to get k.
- Increase the value in the map for the current running sum


Explanation: we keep an accumulator variable sum with the running total of the sum of numbers; we then check if we have already met that values using our seen hashmap that acts more or less like a frequency table, storing how many times we have encountered a specific value: sum - k.

That is why if have met sum - k before and now the value is sum, the difference between those specific points and the current iteration is, by definiton, exactly k: we are now at sum, so, the interval between the previous point(s) and now sums up to, by definition, sum - (sum - k), which equates k.

We collect all those occurrences in count and finally we return it.

And apparently also the most advanced, reading the solution tab:


```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int subarraySum(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int sum=0; // calculated sum
        unordered_map<int, int> rec; // prefix sum recorder.
        int cnt = 0; // number of found subarray
        rec[0]++; // to take into account those subrrays that begin with index 0
        for(int i = 0; i<nums.size(); i++)
        {
            sum += nums[i];
            cnt += rec[sum-k];
            rec[sum]++;
        }
        return cnt;
    }
};
```

## notation

Prefix sum : 어떤 데이터를 누적하여 합한것을 말한다.
