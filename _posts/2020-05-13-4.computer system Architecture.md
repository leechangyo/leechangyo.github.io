- Instruction Set Architecture(ISA): Each CPU implements a specific architecture.
  - an Instruction set is a list of all the program instructions that processor can interpret and execute after fetching the Instruction from the main memory.
  - for this reason, programs compiled for a specific platform can be executed only on the similiar platform for which it has been compiled.
  - the instruction set consists of addressing modes, instructions, native data types, register, memory architecture, interrupt, and exception handling, and external Input/Output.

- Micro Architecture : in computer engineering, micro architecture is a description of the electrical circuitry of a computer, central processing unit that is sufficient for completely describing the operation of the system hardware.(also Referred as computer organization)
  - 즉, 하드웨어 시스템의 운영과 관련

- System Design: it is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules(function), interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements.
  - System design could be seen as the application of systems theory to product developement.

- x86은 32bit 운영체제용이고
- x64는 64bit 운영체제용
- 32bit 파일은 64bit운영체제에 호완되지만 반대는 안된다.
- x64 bit 운영체제는 4GB RAM 이상이여야 한다.
