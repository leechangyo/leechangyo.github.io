- human brain is super intelligent and amazing organ. it helps us do all the calculations, make decision. control all other organs of the body. store and retrieve information.

- human brain can stor information in the brain cells in different parts of our brain and we can also retrieve this information depending upon how that information is stored in our brain.

- human brains has both short term and long term memory and information is stored accordingly.

- A computer system too has memory where data can be stored and retrieved whenever required.

- A computer system can execute any program and process data only when the program and data is loaded in to the main system memory from a secondary memory.

- as per medical science, it seems that our memory is not located in one particular place in the brain, but our memory is instead a brain-wide process in which several different areas of the brain act in conjuction（共同行动） with one another(sometimes referred to as distributed procssing)

- human brain has different types of memory and each has their own particular mode of operation, but as a memory system they all cooperate in the process of memorization and can be ssen as three necessary steps in forming a lasting memory(permanent Memory).

- A computer memory is similar to a human brain. it is used to store both data and instructions(program). A computer memory is the storage space in computer where the data to be processed and intructions(program) required for processing the data are stored.

- Computer system makes the use of different types of memories with differ in capacity, access speed, physical size and the cost of the memory. each of this memory is optimally used in computer system depending upon its access speed, size and proximity((时间或空间) 接近) to the CPU.

- the memory is divided into large number of small parts called cells(1 Cell = 8 bits = 1byte). Each memory loacation or cell has a unique address which varies from zero to memory size minus one.
- for example if computer has 64kb words, then this memory unit has 64*1025 = 65536 bytes cells/ memory locations. the address of these location varies from 0 to 65535(즉 0에서 65535까지의 메모리를 할당하고 있다. 64kb로 된 단어는)

# why computer needs different types / levels of memories?

- the CPU is also alternately referred to as a processor. the CPU is the most important component in a computer system

- A computer's CPU handles all insturctions it recieves from hardware and software running on the computer
