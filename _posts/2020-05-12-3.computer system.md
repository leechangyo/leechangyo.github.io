# What is a Computer System?
- A computer system is a programmable electronics device that can be programmed to accpet some inputs in terms of data, then process this data and provide the Output in the desired format.
- Computer is Digital Electronic Machine
- Computer Needs to be Programmed
- Computer Hardware can execute only Machine Code

- all the programs instructions written in any programming language must be first converted to machine code instructions in binary which can be directly interpreted and executed by the CPU

- A computer system is a programmable electronics device that can be programmed to accpet some input in terms of data, then process this data based on program insturctions and provide the output in the disired format.
- the input is generally in the form of data which is commonly defined as raw facts and observation. data could be in any form such numbers, chracters, alphabets and special symbols.
# A computer consists of four basic Components:

- ALU is the Arithmetic and Logic Unit which performs all the arithmetic and logical operations such as addition, subtraction, logical AND, OR etc. CU is the Control Unit. It decodes the instructions, and controls all the other internal components of the CPU to make it work.

# what is computer hardawre & software?
- Computer consist of two main compenents(Hardware + Software)
- Computer Software : Operation System + System Software + Application Programs

- the computer system mainly consist of hardware components and the software.
- all the physical components inside the computer cabinet and the input/output gadgets attached to the computer are referred as hardware components.
- the hard ware components inside the computer cabinet are referred as internal components such as motherboard
- the external hardware components attached to the computer system are also referred as peripheral devices such as keyboard.
