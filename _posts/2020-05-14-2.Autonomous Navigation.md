# Client System
- ROS
- Hardware Platform

## Client system in autonomous driving
- Requirements
  - Multiple algorithms are integrated to satisfy real-time and reliability requirements.
   - The processing pipeline must be fast enough to handle the vast amount of data generated by the sensor.
   - Sufficient enough to recover even if an error occurs in any part
   - Strict energy and resource constraints must also be met in processing all of these operations.
- Component
  - operating system
  - Hardware platform

# ROS(Robot operating System)

- ROS
  - Powerful distributed computing framework specialized for robotics applications
  - Specific tasks are driven from the node.
  - Nodes communicate with each other through topics and services.
- Problem
  - Reliability: In ROS, there is only one master, and there is no monitor to recover the failed node.
  - Performance: In the process of sending a message in a broadcast manner, the same message may be duplicated multiple times, resulting in a decrease in performance.
  - Security: No authentication and encryption mechanisms.

- responsibility
  - Since there is only one master node, if the master node dies, the entire system dies.
  - This is against the safety requirements of the autonomous driving system.
  - To solve this, a mechanism similar to that of the zookeeper (distributed coordinator) was introduced.
    - When the main master node dies, the backup master node is taken over to operate the system normally.
    - When monitoring through the zookeeper mechanism and detecting a failed node, restart it.

- Performance
  - The communication between the nodes is very frequent, so it must be handled efficiently.
  - Local nodes communicate with each other using a loop-back mechanism, which causes about 20ms of overhead each time.
  - To eliminate this overhead
    - Use shared memory mechanism to process messages to go straight to the destination node without going through the TCP / IP stack
    - ROS node replaces the message communication method from broadcasting to multicast mechanism, greatly reducing the bandwidth consumed by making multiple copies during the broadcasting process.

- security
  - Security problem occurs because there is no symptom and encryption mechanism
    - Because there is no authentication, the node may be down in such a way that it infiltrates the node and continuously allocates memory, exhausting system memory.
    - Since it does not encrypt the messages that are sent and received between nodes, it can be subjected to a man-in-the-middle attack that intercepts them.
  - solution
    - It is solved by using LXC (Linux Container) to limit the amount of allowed resources for each node, and protect the node from the outside through the sandbox mechanism.
    - Encrypt messages sent and received during communication


# ROS1 vs ROS2
- Resolving the reliability, performance, and security problems of ROS1 in ROS2
- Changed data processing method (XMLRPS / TCPROS => DDS / RTPS)
- Multi-node is possible in one process (Peer to Peer communication method does not have a separate master and is performed according to the role.)
- Improving reliability and performance through methods such as notifying the master of the polling method based on the parameter, etc.
- Real-time computing (not for performance, but for final decision)
- Enhanced security through DDS (Data Distribution Service) security
- Compatible with various OS, python3 support, various embedded system support etc. https

# Hardware Platform
- Example
  - Specifications used by autonomous driving companies
    - Usually use 2 compute boxes (main + backup)
    - Processor: Intel Xeon E5 x (1 pc.)
    - GPU: NvidiaK80 x (4 ~ 8)
    - 5,000W power
    - $ 20,000 ~ $ 30,000 (about 2,000 ~ 30 million won or more)
  - Embedded specification
    - ARM SoC
    - 15W power
    - Localization Pipeline: Processing 25 images per second
    - Deep Learning Pipeline: 2-3 objects per second
    - Planning and control pipeline: route planning within 6ms
    - Driving at about 5 miles per hour (8 km / h)

- Example: Apollo test hardware pack presented by Baidu

# Cloud Platform

## Client platform in autonomous driving
- Requirements
  - Because autonomous vehicles are a type of mobile system, a cloud platform that supports them is required.
  - The main functions of the cloud are largely distributed computing (processing, analysis) and distributed storage (storage).
  - Simulation to verify new algorithm
  - HD map production and update
  - Deep Learning Model Learning and Updates
- Required elements
  - Distributed Computing: Spark
  - Heterogeneous Computing: OpenCL
  - In-memory storage: Alluxio

## Simulation
- Reasons for simulation
  - Rigorous testing is required before deploying the newly developed algorithm to the vehicle.
  - Testing with a real car is a huge cost and time consuming and safety issue.
  - Mainly tested in a simulator implemented by playing data on ROS nodes
  - It takes a long time to test on one machine, and the test range is not enough.
  - Distributed computing nodes are managed as sparks, and ROS replay instance is driven for each node.(3 hour test running on one server => test in 25 minutes using 8 nodes through a distributed system)

- Opensource
  - Compatible with various platforms
  - There are many methods based on ROS, Unity, Unreal Engine, etc.
  - LGsvl: led by LG
  - Airsim: led by MS
  - Carla: Intel, Toyota led

## HD MAP
- HD map creation process
  - Original data processing
  - Point cloud creation
  - Point Cloud Alignment
  - 2D reflection map generation
  - HD Map Labeling
  - Create final map
    - Each step is connected to one job through Spark (In-memory computing mechanism eliminates the need to store intermediate data on the hard disk, greatly improving the performance of the map creation process)

## Deeplearning Model
- Requirements
  - Because autonomous driving systems use a variety of deep learning models, it is necessary to update them to continuously improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the model.
  - It is difficult to quickly learn a model using only one server.
  - Requires a distributed deep learning system based on distributed computing platforms (e.g. Spark) and deep learning frameworks (e.g. paddles) (frameworks such as Tensorflow support them on their own)
  - Requires a parameter server (e.g., Luxi)
