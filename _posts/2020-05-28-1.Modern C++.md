# Outline

1. Linux Introduction

2. C++ syntax

# what we will learn

- how to work in Linux
- How to write software with modern c++
- core software development techniques
- how to work with image using OpenCV
- how to implement inverse image search

Check out Google Image search for example: https://images.google.come/

# why C++? why Linux? Why?

- over 50000 developers surveyed
- nearly half of them use linux
- C++ is the most used systems language(4.5 million users in 2015)
- All companies want C++ in our field.

# What is Linux?
- Linux is a free Unix-like OS
- Linux kernel implemented by Linus Torvalds.
- Extremely popular: Android, ChromeOS, servers, supercomputers.
- use any distribution if we have preference

# Linux Directory tree
<a href="https://postimg.cc/ygWLkMGf"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/63fg1wfN/Capture.jpg" width="500px" title="source: imgur.com" /><a>
- Tree organization starting with root: /
- There are no volume letters, e.g. C:, D:
- User can only access his/her own folder

# Understanding files and folders
- Folders end with / e.g. /path/folder/
- Everything else is files, e.g. /path/file
- Absolute paths start with / while all other paths are relative:
  - /home/igor/folder/ — absolute path to a folder
  - /home/igor/file.cpp — absolute path to a file
  - folder/file — relative path to a file
- Paths are case sensitive:
  - filename is different from FileName
- Extension is part of a name:
  - filename.cpp is different from filename.png

# Linux Terminal

<a href="https://postimg.cc/k6nBs9Cc"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Ss9CyNtw/Capture.jpg" width="500px" title="source: imgur.com" /><a>

- Press Ctrl + Alt + T to open terminal
- Linux terminal is a very powerful tool
- Most tasks can be done faster from the terminal than from the GUI

# Navigating tree from terminal

- Terminal is always in some folder
- pwd: print working directory
- cd <dir>: change directory to <dir>
- ls <dir>: list contents of a directory
- Special folders:
  - / — root folder
  - ~ — home folder
  - . — current folder
  - .. — parent folder

# Structure of Linux commands

## Typical structure

**${PATH}/command [ options ] [ parameters ]**

- ${PATH}/command: absolute or relative path to the program binary
- [options]: program-specific options
  - e.g. -h, or --help
- [parameters]: program-specific parameters
  - e.g. input files, etc.

# Use help with Linux programs

- man <command> — manual
  - exhaustive(철저한) manual on program usage
- command -h
- command --help
  - usually shorter help message

# Using command completion
Pressing [tab] while typing:
  - completes name of a file, folder or program
  - “beeps” if current text does not match any file or folder uniquely
Pressing [tab] + [tab] shows all potential matches

## Example :

<a href="https://postimg.cc/GH1hxdjs"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/7Y5GDLGX/Capture.jpg" width="500px" title="source: imgur.com" /><a>

# Creating and manipulating files and folders

- mkdir [-p] <foldername> — make directory
  - Create a folder <foldername> (with all parent folders [-p])
- rm [-r] <name> — remove [recursive]
  - Remove file or folder <name> (With folder contents [-r])
- cp [-r] <source> <dest> — copy
  - Copy file or folder from <source> to <dest>
- mv <source> <dest> — move
  - Move file or folder from <source> to <dest>

# Using placeholders

<a href="https://postimg.cc/PLqmfmph"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/GpFzQKbB/Capture.jpg" width="500px" title="source: imgur.com" /><a>

- Can be used with most of terminal commands: ls, rm, mv etc.

## Example

# Standard input/output channels
- Single input channel: stdin
- Two output channels:
  - stdout: Standard output: channel 1
  - stderr: Standard error output: channel 2
- Redirecting stdout
  - command 1> out.txt
  - command >> out.txt
- Redirecting stderr
  - command 2> out.txt
- Redirect stdout and stderr into a file
  - progamm > out.txt 2>&1
- Write stdout and stderr into different files
  - progamm 1>stdout.txt 2>stderr.txt

# Working with files
- more/less/cat <filename>
  - Most of the time using **cat** if enough
- find <in-folder> -name <filename>
  - Search for file <filename> in folder
  - <in-folder>, allows wildcards
- grep <what> <where>
  - Search for a string <what> in a file <where>

# Chaining commands
- command1; command2; command3
  - Calls commands one after another
- command1 && command2 && command3
  - Same as above but fails if any of the commands returns a non-zero code
- command1 | command2 | command3
  - Pipe stdout of command1 to stdin of command2 and stdout of command2 to stdin of command3
- Piping commonly used with grep:
  - ls | grep smth look for smth in output of ls

# Canceling commands
- CTRL + C
  - Cancel currently running command
- kill -9 <pid>
  - Kill the process with id pid
- killall <pname>
  - Kill all processes with name pname
- htop (top)
  - Shows an overview of running processes
  - Allows to kill processes by pressing F9
# Command history
- The shell saves the history of commands in the ~/.bash_history file

# Installing software
Most of the software is available in the system repository. To install a program in Ubuntu type this into terminal:
- **sudo apt update** to update information about available packages
- **sudo apt install <program>** to install the program that you want
- **Use apt search <program>** to find all packages that provide <program>
- Same for any library, just with lib prefix

# where to write C++ code

# Good code style
Programs are meant to be read by humans and only incidentally for computers to execute. - Donald Knuth

- Use clang_format to format your code
- use cpplint to check the style
- Following a style guide will save you time and make the code more readable
- We use Google Code Style Sheet
- Naming and style recommendations will be marked by GOOGLE-STYLE tag in slides

# Everything starts with main
- Every C++ program starts with main
- main is a function that returns an error code
- Error code 0 means OK
- Error code can be any number in [1, 255]

# #include directive
Two variants:
- #include <file> — system include files
- #include "file" — local include files
  - Copies the content of file into the current file

# I/O streams for simple input and output
- Handle stdin, stdout and stderr:
  - std::cin — maps to stdin
  - std::cout — maps to stdout
  - std::cerr — maps to stderr
- #include <iostream> to use I/O streams
- #include <bits/strc++> to use I/O streams
- Part of C++ standard library

# Compile and run Hello World!
- We understand text
- Computer understands machine code
- Compilation is translation from text to machine code
- Compilers we can use on Linux:
  - GCC
  - Clang [*] [used in examples]
- Compile and run Hello World example:
