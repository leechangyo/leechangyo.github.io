- the compiler produces an executable file as an output which can be executed by the computer's CPU. however, an executable file can run only on certain combination of operating system and processor's inbuilt instruction set architecture for which the program has been compiled. that is the reason why we need to choose the operating system (32bit or 64bit) when we install a language compiler on the computer system.

- A CPU is the brain of the computer system. the microprocessor can interpret and execute the program instructions only in binary code as per the instruction set architecture of the processor.

- therefore, A microprocessor specific compiler is required to compile the program written in any higher level language which generates the executable code for a specific computer system configurations.

- Each CPU's internal design is based on some standard micro architecture which is implemented by the processor manufacturing companies which is known as "Instruction Set Architecture(ISA)"

- AN instruction is a binary pattern design inside a CPU to perform a specific operation.

- the entire group of instruction that is implemented and supported by the microprocessor is called as "Instruction Set". for example ISA 8085 has 246 instructions.

- Each program must be first compiled to generate a machine code in binary which computer's CPU can interpret and execute as per the CPU's instruction set architecture.

- the compiler generates an executable machine code which can be executed only on certain combination of operating system and the processor architecture. this combination of operating system and processor is jointly referred as platform. therefore, a compiler always generates a platform specific machine code.

- A platform is defined as a runtime environment jointly provided by the computer hardware(processor) and the operating system on which a applications / process can run

- the application programs are developed and compiled to create an executable file which is a platform dependent. such application program will run only on computer systems which represents the same platform configuration for which the application program has been compiled.
