- Brain of the computer system
- the cpu(central processing unit) is one of the most important compnent which is responsible to perform all arithmetic calculations and logical operations performed by the computer system.
- the CPU consist of millions of tiny component called "transitor" which is fundamental building block for all CPU. the transistor is used in CPU as tiny switch to define two states "ON" and "OFF"

- Moore's Law is named after GOrdon E. Moore who was co-founder and chairman Emeritus of Intel Corporation. Gordon Moore first published what later became known as Moore's Law in 1964 in a electronics magazine article called "Cramming more components onto integrated circuits". this is actually a observation rather a law.
