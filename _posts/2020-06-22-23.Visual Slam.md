- Frontend: Feature extraction, trajectory/map initial value provision
- Backend: data optimization
- Generated errors are accumulated by considering the relationship between adjacent frames.(인접 frame들의 관계만 고려하면 생성된 에러들이 누적됨)
  - Inaccurate results in long-term estimation, overall inconsistent results
- Backend-post-error estimation, but…
- Good models + Bad data = Bad analysis
- Loop closure detection: provide long-term constraint
  - e.g., Transform the pose between x1-x100 nodes in order
  - Camera passes through the same location and collects similar data
  - **How can you effectively detect a camera passing through the same place?**
- Loop Closure Detection: a very important part of the SLAM system
  - Better closure detection → Better input to backend pose graph → better output
  - Influences the accuracy of the map over time with estimated trajectories
  - Improved accuracy and robustness of the entire SLAM
- VO: front + backend, local consistency
- V-SLAM: VO + loop closure/global backend, global consistency

# How Loop Closure Detection Works?
- Easiest way: any two images → feature correspondence → are they similar?
- Any two images can have a loop back → O(n^2)
- Random sample: randomly extract past data and detect loopback
- As data increases, the probability determined by the loop decreases → detection efficiency decreases
- Odometry based
  - Detect whether there is a loopback relationship when the current camera moves to a position near the previous position
- Appearance based
  - Determine loop closure detection relationship based on the similarity between two images
  - Similarity of images?
