- Multi-core processors can offer significant performance improvements over their single-core counterparts for certain kinds of parallelized tasks, often demanding new programming paradigms to efficiently utilize the complex architecture involved.

- Multi-core processors also present unique challenges for the performance analysis because the architecture of these processors has significant impacts on the way work is scheduled memory is allocated, and the manner in which instructions are executed.

- the multi-core processor computing was a major breakthrough for a CPU architecture and this has significant improved the CPU processing speed.

- nowadays, multi-core processors are industry standard and quite cheaper. today, almost all new generations of processors are multi-core with more than one cores. the data centre computers usually have more than 4, 7, 32 cores. that means again the hardware industry has left the software industry behind.

- A multi-core processor is a single computing component with two or more independent actual processing units (Called "cores"). there are units that read an execute program instructions.

- these instructions are ordinary CPU instructions, but the multiple cores can execute multiple instructions concurrently and increasing overall speed for programs.

- the functional programming is ideal for multi-core computing. Functional programming is also best suited for the concurrent and distributed computing as it is much easier to implement the parallel processing (Parallelism)

- the concurrent processing is computing model in which multiple processors execute instructions simultaneously for better performance. Concurrent means something that happens at the same time.
