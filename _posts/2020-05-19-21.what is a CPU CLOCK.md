# CPU - CLOCK

- all computer contain an internal clock that regulates the rate at which instrucions are executed by the CPU and synchronizes all the various computer components

- Every microprocessor requires a clock for its functioning. the CPU requires a fixed number of clock ticks/ pulse (called as clock cycle/clock speed) to execute each instruction.

- A clock signal is a particular types of signal that oscillates between high and low state and these two states are utilized to coordinate operation of the various components within a computer system.

- A clock signal is produced by a clock generator (Quartz Oscillating Cristal). the Most common clock signal is in the form of a square wave.

- An executable program contains number of program instructions in the binary code which a CPU interpret as per instruction set and execute one by one

- An instruction is a command given to a computer processor by a computer program. at the lowest level, each instruction is a sequance of 0s and 1s that describes a physical operation to be performed by the CPU (such as "add" OR "Multiply")

- for every tick (one digital pulse) of the clock, the CPU is able to process one piece of data or execute one instruction OR only part of the instruction for large instruction.

- some processors execute only one instruction per clock pulse. more advanced processors can perfrom more than on instruction per clock puls. the procssing speed of such processors will be more as CPU can execute more instructions per clock cycle.

- there are some other factors in addition to clock speed which affect the CPU processing speed such bit size of the "BUS" and size of the main memory RAM.

- A computer with a 32-bit bus will work faster at a given clock speed than a computer with a 16-bit bus. for these reasons, there is no simplistic, universal relation amongst clock speed, bus speed and millions of instructions per second(MIPS) executed by the CPU.
