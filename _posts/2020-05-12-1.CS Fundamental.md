# Computer Science(CS) vs Information Technology(IT)

- 대표적으로
  - CS : Technology Designer & Developers
  - IT : Technology Implimenters and Practicioners
- Career Focus
  - CS : The Computer Science professionals study the design and purpose of computer especially the mechanics of computation, data processing and system control. they understand the intricacies(繁琐复杂) of computer theory and master the mathematical algorithms necessary to write the code and develop innovative computer hardware, software programs and operating systems
  - IT : IT professionals use computer system, software and networks to process and distribute the data. they find technologicl solution for business needs by adapting, developing, maintaining the operating system and programs designed by the computer scientist. IT has become business critical element for day to day operations and maintenane of IT infrastructure for small and large companies
