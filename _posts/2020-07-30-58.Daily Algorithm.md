-  Since * can be used as 3 kinds of char, if we do backtrack the complexity can blow up if the string is *****.... We need to find **a non-trivial method.**(Nontrivial is a favorite word among programmers and computer people for describing any task that is not quick and easy to accomplish. It may mean "extremely" difficult and time consuming.)

-  Without * , we can just use a number to indicate the unmatch (, ( will increment it and ) will decrement it. We don't want this number less than 0 all the time and it should be 0 when all the string has been matched.

- When * is introduced, the number becomes a range, indicating *the number of possible unmatched* ( found. One * just expand the range by 1. And we can use the same principle to check if the criteria above is within the range.



```

class Solution {
public:
    bool checkValidString(string s) {
        int lower = 0, upper = 0;
        for(auto c : s )
        {
            if(c=='(')
            {
                lower++;
                upper++;
            }
            else if( c == ')')
            {
                lower--;
                upper--;
            }
            else // enconuter '*'
            {
                lower--;
                upper++;
            }
            lower = max(lower,0);
            if(upper<0) // unmatched ')' found in the middle of string
                return false;
        }
        return lower == 0;

    }
};

```
