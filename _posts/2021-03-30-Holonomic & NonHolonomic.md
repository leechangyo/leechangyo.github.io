A holonomic constraint is constraint on configuration : it says there are places you cannot go. that is a reduction in freedoms. that's (usually) bad

A NonHolonomic constraint is a constraint on velocity : there are direction you cannot go. but you can still get wherever you want. that's (usually) good
