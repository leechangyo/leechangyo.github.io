# Feature Point
- Basic concepts
  - Definition: The point of local uniqueness in the frame
    - It should be able to discern even if the object's size, position, camera point of view, lighting, etc. change.
- Applicable fields: recognition, detection, tracking, classification…
- property
  - Repeatability: The same area can be found in different frame.
  - Differentiation: Feature points in different region have different expressions.
  - Efficiency: The number of feature points in the image should be smaller than the number of pixels.
  - Locality: Feature points relate only to the local area of the image.
- Configuration(구성)
  - Keypoint: Location information of feature points
  - Descriptor: A vector describing information about surrounding pixels

- Harris corner detector
  - In a small window in an image, the part with large image change in all directions is regarded as a corner
  - The point where the image change value of the pixel is locally maximized is used as the corner point.

- Shi-Tomasi
  - Good features should be able to be optimized for tracking algorithms!
  - Both simple translation and affine changes are considered.
  - Only the smallest of the two eigenvalues is considered.

# Scale Invariant Feature Transform(SIFT)
- You need strong points such as changes in size, direction and lighting!
  - Result of picking feature vectors for local patches centering on identifiable feature points
  - It expresses the direction and rapid degree of regional brightness change.
  - Due to the large amount of computation, it is not suitable for real-time SLAM implementation.
    - Of course, it can be complemented by GPU programming
  - The Difference of Gaussian method was used to compensate for the large amount of computation in the Laplacian of Gaussian method.
  - Laplacian: 2nd derivative of the brightness of the image

- Difference of Gaussian(DoG)

- Process
  - Scale-space extrema detection: Potential feature point candidates robust to changes in size and direction are extracted based on the difference of Gaussian for all scales.
  - keypoint localization: For each extrema, low-contrast points and points in the edge region are removed.
  - Orientation assignment: directional assignment based on local gradient for each point
  - Keypoint descriptor: 16x16 size block -> 4x4 sub-block unit
    - Generate 8 bin histogram of direction in each sub-block
    - Finally, create a 128 dimensional vector

# Oriented-FAST and Rotated-BRIEF(ORB)
- quickly detect feature points based on the apparent change in brightness of grayscale

- Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features(BRIEF)
  - Descriptor vector is composed of binary numbers.
  - Decide the binary number to treat as the vector through comparison between two pixels in the patch

  - Random two pixel pairs are randomly determined based on probability distribution
  - Generate 128bit binary descriptor by comparing 128 pairs

- Oriented-FAST
  - The weakness of FAST is that it does not have direction and scale.
  - Solve scale immutability problems with image pyramids
  - Connect the geometric center **O** and the moment-based center **C** to find the direction for it

- Rotated-BRIEF
  - Conventional BRIEF does not have rotational invariance
  - Use of keypoint direction information obtained during FAST detection
  - Use Steer BRIEF: Performs BRIEF after rotating according to the direction information

# Correspondence matching(대응 매칭)
- Basic concepts
  - Process required to perform data association process in SLAM
  - The process of correctly matching descriptors between images and images, or images and maps
  - Problems caused by repetitive textures can cause inconsistent accumulation!
- Brute-force matcher
  - The point with the shortest descriptor distance between feature points in two different images is regarded as a matching point.
  - Generally, descriptor distance means similarity
  - Euclid distance, Hamming distance...
  - If the number of dots increases, the calculation amount increases, which is not efficient.
- Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors(FLANN)
  - Matching library for fast matching in high Dimension
  - Real-time matching is suitable for SLAM
