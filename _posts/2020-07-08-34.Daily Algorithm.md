```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int climbStairs(int n) {
        if(n<=1)
        {
            return n;
        }
        vector<int> steps(n,0); // n 행렬, element 값 0
        steps[0] = 1;
        steps[1] = 2;
        for(int i=2; i<n; i++)
        {
            steps[i] = steps[i-2] + steps[i-1];
        }
        return steps[n-1];

    }
};
```

- Array 'steps' stands for how many distinct(明显) ways to climb to each level (index from 0, so 0 means level 1, 1 means level 2 and so on.... ). It's trivial to know it has 1 distinct way to climb to stair 1 , and 2 distinct ways to climb to stair 2 . For stair level n (n>=3) , you can either (1) climb to stair n-2 , and climb 2 more steps to reach n , OR (2) climb to stair n-1, and climb 1 more step to reach n. That said , steps[n]=steps[n-1]+steps[n-2]. In another word, the number of distinct ways to reach level n is the sum of number of distinct ways to reach level n-1 and n-2.

- 확률적인 개수가 몇개인지 알아보려고 할떄 steps[n]=steps[n-1]+steps[n-2] 많이 쓰인다.
- Fibonacci 방법중에 하나이다.
