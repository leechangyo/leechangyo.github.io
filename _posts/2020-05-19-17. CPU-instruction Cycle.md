- it is the CPU which is mainly responsible to execute the program the operating system allocates the necessary resources to run the program

- each of these program contains number of program statements which are instructions to the CPU to perform a particular task and a CPU floows machine instruction cycle(Fetch, Decode,Execute & Store) repetitively to execute the program.

- A instruction cycle, also called a processor cycle of a machine cycle, which is the basic operation performed by a CPU

- A CPU is the main component which performs all arithmetic calculations and takes logical decisions in a computer system.

- A CPU can execute the instruction either in a single machine cycle or multiple machine cycles depending upon the complexity of the instruction.

- A machine cycle consists of a sequence of four steps that are performed continously and at a rate of millions times per second while a program is being executed.

- During the fourth step, store, in which the result of the processing done by the CPU is stored in main memory for later use Or sent to output device. however, no actual processing is performed during this step.

- the CPU fecthes and executes program instruction from the main system memory RAM sequentially one by one. each instruction is processed by the CPU before the next one is started.

- however, in most modern CPU, the instruction cycles are instead executed concurrently, and often in parallel, through an instruction pipeline. the instruction pipeline enable the OS to optimize on the CPU's processing time.

- in non-pipelined execution, the next instruction processing start only after processing of the previous instruction has finished, this is possible because the execution cycle is broken up into seperate steps. this is referred as serail processiong
  - non-pipelined execution 은 즉 병렬 프로세싱이아닌 직렬 프로세싱 뜻함
- in pipelined execution, the next instruction processing starts een before the processing of previous instruction has finished. this processing is referred as parallel processing
  - pipeline execution, 병렬 프로세시싱

  - the CPUs instruction cycle is executed sequentially and each instruction is processed by CPU which consist of following steps:
    - Read an instruction from memory
    - Decode the instruction as per OPCODE
    - Find the address of operand
    - Retrieve an operand
    - perform the desired operation
    - Find the address of destination memory.
    - Store the result into the destination memory.
