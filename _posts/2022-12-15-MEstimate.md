M-Esitmator :

- Non Linear Convex Problem, to solve this problem.
- solve problem in iteraritvely optmizing by object function(cost function).
- to update parameter to do iteration, we need to have some speicifc weight to update parameter by object function.
- to avoid local minimum problem, there is many kind of ways to optimization is we called M-Estimator.
