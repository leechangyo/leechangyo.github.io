In mathematics, an injective function (also known as injection , or one-to-one function ) is a function f that maps distinct elements to distinct elements; that is, f ( x 1 ) = f ( x 2 ) implies x 1 = x 2 . In other words, every element of the function's codomain is the image of at most one element of its domain.
