# Outline

1. Variables and baisc types
  - built-in types
  - Strings
  - Vector and array

2. Control structures
  - If statement
  - Switch statement
  - Loops

# Declaring variables
Variable declaration always follows pattern:
  - <TYPE> <NAME> [ = <VALUE>];
- Every variable has a type
- Variables cannot change their type
- Always initialize variables if you can

```c++
int sad_uninitialized_var;
 bool initializing_is_good = true;
```

# Naming variables
- Name must start with a letter
- Give variables meaningful names
- Don’t be afraid to use longer names
- Don’t include type in the name
- Don’t use negation in the name
- GOOGLE-STYLE name variables in **snake_case** all lowercase, underscores separate words
- C++ is case sensitive:
  - some_var is different from some_Var

# Built-in types
“Out of the box” types in C++:

# Operations on arithmetic types
- All character, integer and floating point types are arithmetic
- Arithmetic operations: +, -, * , /
- Comparisons <, >, <=, >=, == return bool
- a += 1 ⇔ a = a + 1, same for -=, * =, /=, etc
- Avoid == for floating point types

# Some additional operations
- Boolean variables have logical operations
  - or: ||, and: &&, not: !

```c++
bool is_happy = (!is_hungry && is_warm) || is_rich
```

- Additional operations on integer variables:
  - / is integer division: i.e. 7 / 3 == 2
  - % is modulo division: i.e. 7 / 3 == 1
  - Increment operator: a++ ⇔ ++a ⇔ a += 1
  - Decrement operator: a-- ⇔ --a ⇔ a -= 1
  - Do not use de- increment operators within another expression, i.e. a = (a++) + ++b

# Strings
- #include <string> to use std::string
- Concatenate strings with +
- Check if str is empty with str.empty()
- Works out of the box with I/O streams

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
int main() {
  std::string hello = "Hello";
  std::cout << "Type your name:" << std::endl;
  std::string name = ""; // Init empty.
  std::cin >> name; // Read name.
  std::cout << hello + ", " + name + "!" << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

# Use std::array for fixed size collections of items(allocate stack memory as static programming)
- #include <array> to use std::array
- Store a collection of items of same type
- Create from data:
  - array<float, 3> arr = {1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f};
- Access items with arr[i]
  - indexing starts with 0
- Number of stored items: arr.size()
- Useful access aliases:
  - First item: arr.front() == arr[0]
  - Last item: arr.back() == arr[arr.size() - 1]

# Use std::vector when number of items is unknown before-wise(allocated heap memory as dynamic programming)

- #include <vector> to use std::vector
- Vector is implemented as a dynamic table
- Access stored items just like in std::array
- Remove all elements: vec.clear()
- Add a new item in one of two ways:
  - vec.emplace_back(value) [preferred, c++11]
  - vec.push_back(value) [historically better known]
- Use it! It is fast and flexible!
  - Consider it to be a default container to store collections of items of any same type

# Optimize vector resizing
- Many push_back/emplace_back operations force vector to change its size many times
- reserve(n) ensures that the vector has enough memory to store n items
- The parameter n can even be approximate
- This is a very important optimization

```c++
std::vector <std::string > vec;
const int kIterNum = 100;
// Always call reserve when you know the size.
for (int i = 0; i < kIterNum; ++i) {
  vec.emplace_back("hello");
}
```

# Example Vector

```c++
#include <string >
#include <vector >
#include <iostream >
using namespace std;
int main() {
  vector <int> numbers = {1, 2, 3};
  vector <string > names = {"Igor", "Cyrill"};
  names.push_back("another_string");
  cout << "First name: " << names.front() << endl;
  cout << "Last number: " << numbers.back() << endl;
  return 0;
}

```

# Variables live in scopes
- There is a single global scope
- Local scopes start with { and ends with }
- All variables belong to the scope where they have been declared
- All variables die in the end of their scope
- This is the core of C++ memory system

```c++
int main()// Start of main scope.
{
  float some_float = 13.13f; // Create variable.
  {
    // New inner scope
    auto another_float = some_float; // Copy variable.
  } // another_float dies
  return 0;
}// some_float dies.

```

# Any variable can be const
- Use const to declare a constant
- The compiler will guard it from any changes
- Keyword const can be used with any type
- GOOGLE-STYLE name constants in CamelCase starting with a small letter k:
  - const float kImportantFloat = 20.0f;
  - const int kSomeInt = 20;
  - const std::string kHello = "hello";
- const is part of type:
  - variable kSomeInt has type const int
- Tip: declare everything const unless it must be changed

# References to variables
- We can create a reference to any variable
- Use & to state that a variable is a reference
  - float& ref = original_variable;
  - std::string& hello_ref = hello;
- Reference is part of type: variable ref has type float&
- Whatever happens to a reference happens to the variable and vice versa
- **Yields performance gain as references avoid copying data**

# Const with references
- References are fast but reduce control
- To avoid unwanted changes use const
  - const float& ref = original_variable;
  - const std::string& hello_ref = hello;

```c++
#include <iostream >
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int num = 42; // Name has to fit on slides
  int& ref = num;
  const int& kRef = num;
  ref = 0;
  cout << ref << " " << num << " " << kRef << endl; // output 0 0 0
  num = 42;
  cout << ref << " " << num << " " << kRef << endl; // output 42 42 42
  return 0;
}
```

# If statement

```c++
if (STATEMENT) {
// This is executed if STATEMENT == true
} else if (OTHER_STATEMENT) {
// This is executed if:
// (STATEMENT == false) && (OTHER_STATEMENT == true)
} else {
// This is executed if neither is true
}
```

- Used to conditionally execute code
- All the else cases can be omitted if needed
- STATEMENT can be any boolean expression

# Switch Statement

```c++
switch(STATEMENT) {
  case CONST_1:
    // This runs if STATEMENT == CONST_1.
    break;
  case CONST_2:
    // This runs if STATEMENT == CONST_2.
    break;
  default:
    // This runs if no other options worked.
}
```

- Used to conditionally execute code
- Can have many case statements
- break exits the switch block
- STATEMENT usually returns **int** or **enum** value

# While loop

```c++
while (STATEMENT) {
  // Loop while STATEMENT == true.
}
```
### Example while loop:

```c++
bool condition = true;
while (condition) {
  condition = /* Magically update condition. * /
}

```

- Usually used when the exact number of iterations is unknown before-wise
- Easy to form an endless loop by mistake

# For loop
```c++
for (INITIAL_CONDITION; END_CONDITION; INCREMENT) {
  // This happens until END_CONDITION == false
}
```

### Example for Loop
```c++
for (int i = 0; i < COUNT; ++i) {
  // This happens COUNT times.
}
```
- In C++ for loops are very fast. Use them!
- Less flexible than while but less error-prone
- Use for when number of iterations is fixed and while otherwise

# Range for loop
- Iterating over a standard containers like array or vector has simpler syntax
- Avoid mistakes with indices
- Show intent with the syntax
- Has been added in C++11

```c++
for (const auto& value : container) {
  // This happens for each value in the container.
}
```

# Exit loops and iterations
- We have control over loop iterations
- Use **break** to exit the loop
- Use **continue** to skip to next iteration

```c++
while (true) {
  int i = /* Magically get new int. *
  if (i % 2 == 0) {
    cerr << i << endl;
  }
  else{
    break;
  }
}
```

# Git

- Free software for distributed version control
- synchronizes local and remote files
- stores a history of all changes

# What is synchronized?
- Local files on a computer
- Remote Files in the repository
- We are using a Gitlab server

# Typical workflow
Cloning a repository:
  - git clone <repo_url> <local_folder>
In <local_folder>:
  - Change files
  - git add <files>
  - git commit -am 'descriptive message'
  - git push origin master
