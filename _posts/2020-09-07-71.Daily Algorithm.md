## Explanation

1. Solution Bit Manipulation
the idea is :
as we need to find *the Num is power of 4 or not*
We Can Solve it by doing **Bit Manipulation**

- [if Any num is valid power of 4 then it should be valid power of 2 as well] <- use this property

Let's Suppose it they are asking for finding is the num is power of 2 or not then what should we do
**We just trying to find is that Num Have only one set bit or Not**
if there is only One set bit exist then we can blindly say that it's A valid power of 2

so, the same idea we need here also but need to check one more condition.

what is the 2nd Condition would be. Let's Find out by analysing Few Example

1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 592 1084 ...... -> This All Are Power Of Two **[ Mean Having Only One Set Bit ]**

1 4 16 64 256 1084......-> This All Are Power Of Four , Now We can Greedly Observe **That Between two power_of_4 there Was One Invaild Power_Of_4 Exist**

So Conditions Are :

1. No of Set Bit Always Be Only ONE
2. That SetBit Possition Should Be always In odd Place [ starting from Left ]

Let's See Example :

 No            Bit_re             SetBitPos       No_of_setBit          Valid_power_of_four
64         1 0 0 0 0 0 0           7                  1                        True         <= :)
128        1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0         8                  1                        False        <=2nd Condition fail :(
18         1 0 0 1 0               5,2                2                        False        <=1st Condition Fail :(
32         1 0 0 0 0 0             6                  1                        False        <=2nd Condition fail :(

Time Complexcity O ( 1 )    =>as we Only Traverse max 32 Bit
Space Complexcity O ( 1)   => No Extra Space



### Solution 1

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPowerOfFour(int num) {
        if(num<0)
            return false;
        for(int i=0;i<32;i+=2)
        {
            if(num==1<<i) // 두개씩 왼쪽 쉬프트해서 1이 되는 값이 나오면 true
                return true;
        }
        return false;


    }
};
```

## Solution 2

```c++
return num>0&&!(num&(num-1))&&!((num-1)%3);
```
